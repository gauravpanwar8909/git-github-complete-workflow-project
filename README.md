# Git & Github Complete Workflow Project 

## Overview
This project demonstrates a real-world Git and GitHub workflow used in software companies.
It shows how feature branches are created, merged, and how merge conflicts are resolved.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Feature branch based development
- Develop and master branch workflow
- Real merge conflict creation and resolution
- Clean and professional commit history
- Branch cleanup after merge
- GitHub remote repository usage

## Branching Strategy
- master → production-ready final code
- develop → active development branch
- feature branches → login, signup, UI changes
- conflict branches → merge conflict practice

## Workflow Followed
1. Git repository initialized
2. develop branch created for development
3. Feature branches created from develop
4. Features committed separately
5. Features merged into develop
6. Merge conflict created and resolved manually
7. Unused branches deleted
8. develop merged into master for release
9. Code pushed to GitHub

## Merge Conflict Handling
A real merge conflict was intentionally created by changing the same line in different branches.
The conflict was resolved manually by editing the file and committing the fix.

## Git Commands Used
git init  
git add  
git commit  
git branch  
git checkout  
git merge  
git log --graph --oneline  
git branch -d / -D  
git push  

## Purpose
This repository is created to showcase practical Git and GitHub knowledge for interviews and real-world development.
