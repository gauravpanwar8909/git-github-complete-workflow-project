# Git & GitHub Complete Workflow Project

##  Overview
This project demonstrates a real-world Git and GitHub workflow used in software companies.  
It showcases how developers work with feature branches, handle merge conflicts, and release stable code using proper branch strategies.

---

##  What This Project Demonstrates
- Practical usage of Git commands
- Feature-based development workflow
- Clean and professional commit history
- Real merge conflict creation and resolution
- Develop → Master release strategy
- Branch cleanup and lifecycle management

---

##  Branching Strategy
- **master** → Production-ready / final code
- **develop** → Active development branch
- **feature-* branches** → Feature development (login, signup, UI)
- **conflict-demo branches** → Merge conflict practice

---

##  Workflow Followed
1. Initialized Git repository
2. Created `develop` branch for development
3. Created feature branches from `develop`
4. Committed features separately
5. Merged features back into `develop`
6. Created and resolved real merge conflicts
7. Cleaned up unused branches
8. Merged `develop` into `master` for final release
9. Pushed code to GitHub

---

##  Merge Conflict Handling
A real merge conflict was intentionally created by modifying the same line in different branches.
The conflict was resolved manually by editing the file and committing the resolution.

This reflects real-life collaboration scenarios in development teams.
